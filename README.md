# 🎬 CineScope — React Movie Explorer

CineScope is a modern React web application that allows users to **search for trending movies**, **discover new titles**, and **bookmark favorites** for later viewing.

Built using **React.js**, this project helped me strengthen my understanding of **state management**, **React hooks**, and **API integration**. The movie data is fetched dynamically from an external movie API.

- Work with **React hooks** like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Fetch data from APIs using **Axios**.
- Use **React Router** for smooth navigation.
